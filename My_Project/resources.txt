^ A guys API for TV shows and Movies of MCU
^This may be exactly what I am looking for!!!!!!!!!!
^ https://mcuapi.herokuapp.com/docs/#/Movies/get_api_v1_movies
    ^ In /api/v1/movies- Change filter "title=Thor" to have it search for movies with that title
    ^ Another one for TV shows as well
    ^ I could use the curl module and the link/command shown to let a user give input to search
        for Marvel movie titles (If my other ideas or too complicated and need something simple like this)
    ^ Use /api/v1/movies/{movie_id} to choose the  movie_id which is the numbered order by release 
    ^Also has trailer links- could potentially ask user if they want the link (and give it after asking, if pulling the data isn't too complex)

Had help from Brother Birch multiple times to figure out errors and to understand how I can do or redo my functions
Quickly looked at like 6+ sites to see if any of them would make sense on how I can test my print_TV_search()- most of them were stackoverflow
^ Was told by Brother Birch that I do not need to test print functions.
