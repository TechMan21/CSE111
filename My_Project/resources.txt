^ A guys API for TV shows and Movies of MCU
^This may be exactly what I am looking for!!!!!!!!!!
^ https://mcuapi.herokuapp.com/docs/#/Movies/get_api_v1_movies
    ^ In /api/v1/movies- Change filter "title=Thor" to have it search for movies with that title
    ^ Another one for TV shows as well
    ^ I could use the curl module and the link/command shown to let a user give input to search
        for Marvel movie titles (If my other ideas or too complicated and need something simple like this)
    ^ Use /api/v1/movies/{movie_id} to choose the  movie_id which is the numbered order by release 
    ^Also has trailer links- could potentially ask user if they want the link (and give it after asking, if pulling the data isn't too complex)
