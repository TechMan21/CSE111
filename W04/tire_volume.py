#Finding the Volume of a tire with user input

#  v is the volume in liters,
# Ï€ is the constant PI, which is the ratio of the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter (use math.pi),
# w is the width of the tire in millimeters,
# a is the aspect ratio of the tire, and
# d is the diameter of the wheel in inches.



width = int(input("Please enter the width of the tire (in mm- Ex: 255): " ))
aspect = int(input("Please enter the aspect ratio pf the same tire (Ex: 55): "))
diameter = int(input("Please also enter the diameter of that wheel in inches (Ex: 18): "))

volume = math.pi * (width ** 2) * aspect * (width * aspect + (2540 * diameter))/10000000000
