Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
    A: Once instance may be doing the sentences.py program. That was many lists and indexes which the further
    we got into it, the harder it got. However, we were able to create random (functional) sentences each time we
    ran the program.



2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
    A: They are fairly helpful. They can run multiple inputs/vairbales into the
     function to see if an error will get pulled. No one wants errors after thinking they are done with their code.



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
    A: When a or my own program spits out an error, I first examine what the error is. If it is more simple
    like "SyntaxError" then I will look at the line it points out and look for a mistake that may have been made.
    If it is an error I do not understand I may quickly google it and see what it relates to so I can understand
    what to look for. I then may use the debugger and follow a vairbale or item that may be causing the error and
    see where it goes wrong.If part of the problem was that figuring out my error was harder because I ran multiple
    (new) funtions at once, then maybe I can try to just make and run one function at a time. Otherwise, be a bit
    careful to not use a ton of variables so I do not make the program confusing.
